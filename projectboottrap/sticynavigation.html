    <h2>Ukrain war</h2>
    
       <p>European military heavyweights Germany and Poland affirmed Tuesday that they would not be sending troops to Ukraine. The statement comes after reports that some Western countries may be considering doing so as the war with Russia enters its third year. The head of NATO also said the U.S.-led military alliance has no plans to send troops to Ukraine. The Kremlin, meanwhile, warned that a direct conflict between NATO and Russia would be inevitable if the alliance sends combat troops. Moscow's warning came a day after French President Emmanuel Macron said that sending in Western ground troops should not be “ruled out” in the future.</p>

   <p>Major Social Issues
    There are a lot of social issues we are facing right now, some more prominent than the others. First of all, poverty is a worldwide issue. It gives birth to a lot of other social issues which we must try to get away with at the earliest.
    
    Further, countries like India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and more are facing the issue of the caste system since times unknown. It results in a lot of caste violence and inequality which takes the lives of many on a daily basis.
    
    Moreover, child labour is another major social issue that damages the lives of young children. Similarly, illiteracy also ruins the lives of many by destroying their chances of a bright future.
    
    In developing countries mostly, child marriage still exists and is responsible for ruining many lives. Similarly, dowry is a very serious and common social issue that almost all classes of people partake in.
    
    Another prominent social issue is gender inequality which takes away many opportunities from deserving people. Domestic violence especially against women is a serious social issue we must all fight against.
    
    Other social issues include starvation, child sex abuse, religious conflicts, child trafficking, terrorism, overpopulation, untouchability, communalism and many more. It is high time we end these social issues.
